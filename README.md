# .Net-Areas
"Areas" in dot net  refer to a feature primarily used in ASP.NET MVC applications to organize and manage large applications by dividing them into smaller, more manageable sections. Each area can contain its own set of controllers, views, and models, allowing for better separation of concerns and modular development.
